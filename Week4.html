        <h3> Our Love for Complexity</h3>
    
    <p>On my 18th birthday, I treated myself to a trip to the NYC natural history museum, in blissful solitude permitting endless time to meander. In prior visits, I was pushed every which way, and neglected to pay full attention to each plaque and description. Meandering through the agricultural section, I gazed into “The Forest Primeval.” <br><br>

“Before the arrival of the Europeans, the American Indian practiced a primitive form of agriculture. Their principal crops, corn, beans and pumpkins, required little or no equipment for harvesting. The earth was turned in preparation for planting by a simple digging stick which was practically all the equipment used. Power was exclusively human. Among the Algonquin Indians, women ordinarily cared for their small and simple gardens.” <br><br>

Later plaques in the exhibit described how the European farming was “characterized by a growing complexity of equipment,” and how, while the soil was destroyed by these “complex” methods, there is no reason to worry because “with careful management the forest will again produce valuable timber.” <br><br>

In the year of 2024, I was taken aback by the fact that we were using words like “primitive” and “simple” to describe indigenous american practices, especially that of farming. In actuality, indigenous farming mimicked the natural complexity of the forest, using intercropping and polycultures. Intercropping is the practice of planting multiple complementary species together, increasing crop yield. In Robin Wall Kimmerer’s Braiding Sweetgrass, she outlines an example of intercropping, the Iroquis “Three Sisters:” beans, corn, and squash. Beans fix nitrogen for corn and squash, corn provides a stalk for the beans, and squash’s broad leaves preserve soil moisture and halt weed growth. A polyculture is a similar concept that focuses on growing multiple species together in a way to mimic nature. These practices not only require complex planning, but they also preserve soil health by maintaining nutrient levels.<br><br>

Western farming on the other hand, can be considered exceedingly simple. Planting rows and rows of a singly monoculture crop, such as wheat or corn, without any consideration for ecosystems, is not a “complex” concept. Western complexity is added by the technology used to improve its lower efficiency and as a weak bandaid for the ecological harms of this practice. Throughout the 19th century, for example, an added complexity of farming included sending ships on six-month journeys to South America, waiting in line to literally ship off fertile land, the Guano Islands, because European and American soil were so depleted by a few decades of “complex” agriculture. This inspired America’s 1856 Guano Islands Act, which declared that if an American found an uninhabited island with a sufficient amount of fertile guano, they had the right to claim it as American soil. This act resulted in the seizure of about 100 islands in the Pacific and Caribbean. <br><br>

Modern fertilizer is made through industrial methods, utilizing the 70% nitrogen composition in the air to create liquid ammonia. Instead of preserving this nitrogen via composting, Earth’s clean method of breaking down organic matter and returning nutrients to the soil, we either imprison food scraps to plastic bags, decomposing into greenhouse gas methane, or we imprison it to a life in incinerated parts, suspended in air as greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. How complex.<br><br>

Given that both systems include complexities, I’d like to investigate our glorification of complexity. Humans, self titled “Homo Sapiens,” meaning “Wise Men,” are defined by our intellect. This is used as justification for just about everything: Original creation, where God created humans in his image and designed the world for his children; animal cruelty, because animals cannot understand pain or the world as humans can; and entitlement to land despite what life is already inhabiting it. We deserve the world because we are smart. <br><br>

In Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, the book that sparked a revolution in 20th century land management awareness, Carson describes our need to dominate land, show the plants who’s boss. Nature, a 3.7 billion year long game of trial-and-error is the most interconnected and complicated management system for life to possibly exist. Everything impacts everything; the Gaia hypothesis conveys this principle by characterizing the Earth as one big system, all pieces working in tandem. With all this complexity built into nature, how can we hubristically assume that we can sustainably work outside of it? Conquer with chemicals and assume it won’t fight back? In Carson’s case, our brilliant idea to kill pests not only created pesticide/herbicide resistance, but also permanently harmed human bodies (not to mention entire ecosystems), as DDT continues to exist within modern humans. Our brilliant engineering, “complex” solutions, the talents of us “wise men,” have backfired into an ecological and climate crisis that currently threatens 99% of life on Earth.  <br><br>
 
Scientifically, complexity has a different connotation. Occam's razor, or the 'law of parsimony' is the principle that the simplest conclusion is the best one. It’s how when a cookie goes missing from the jar, you conclude that it was eaten, not that it spontaneously disappeared out of existence. Doctors will diagnose someone with a runny nose with a common cold before considering cancer. Engineers maximize efficiency through the simplest option. Think, is the website with the most buttons and colors or the one that’s simple and easy to use a better experience? <br><br>

All this to say that “complexity” may be the wrong word to describe Western agriculture. As stewards, what are our values for how we interact with land? If the answer is land preservation, reducing environmental destruction, or even yield, the Western method fails every time to indigenous practices. Western idealization of complexity and trust in our intellect may not only be wrong, but also unfounded.<br><br>
