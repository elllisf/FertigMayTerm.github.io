    <h3>The Farm</h3>
    
        
    <h4>Day 1</h4>
    <ul style="font-size:15px">
        <li> I flew to Ithaca NY, to visit the farm.</li>
        <li> The first thing I noticed about Loving Farms was the smell. It was so sweet and light, not like what I had imagined a farm to smell like.</li>
        <li> I took a tour, and was amazed to see so many wild patches of flowers and friendly bees visiting them. This is what I wish more lawns looked like.</li>
        <li>For dinner, I had a salad bowl with greens, rice, beans, avocados, carrots, and sweet potato. Very flavorful!</li>
        </ul>
        
        
         <h4>Day 2</h4>
    <ul style="font-size:15px">
        <li> I woke up at 7:30 to go to Ms. Branker's tiny home and bonded with the cats.</li>
        <li> For breakfast, she eats cereal bowls with ~25 different types of grains. We also had fruit, peanut butter, and cinnamon! I was surprised by how tasty her vegan diet is.</li>
        <li> I took a tour of her neighbor's, the Whitmore's, farm. They had a tiny-home air-bnb, sheep, pigs, chickens, their own farm, many native plants, and they owned a bookstore. This family also built many of the neighborhood's tiny homes. I loved their philosophy of working for what they need themselves instead of working to pay someone else. I also loved the lambs.</li>
        <li>I helped Ms. Branker assemble her vegan, refined-sugar free peanut butter oat cookies, </li>
        </ul>
