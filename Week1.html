    <h4>A Clear Solution to an Unknown Problem:</h4>
        
    <h4> The Problem:</h4>
    
            
            
        <p class="text-content" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">Where does food come from? When imagining how vegetables are created, we consider a farmer in the midwest, wearing blue denim overalls and a straw hat hand-harvesting the perfect fruit, smiling at the reward for a hard-working summer. His farm, passed down for generations, with lots of vegetables, fruits, and a few cows and chickens, isn't much, but it will make do. What we don't consider is how this land is getting harder and harder to work with, literally blowing away in the wind. <br><br> What does a farmer even do? Yes, he plants seeds and waits. Additionally, he must till the soil to aerate, and weed so that only his crop receives the land's nourishment. If he exists after WWII, he adds a bit of fertilizer and pesticides along the way. This method of farming, tilling and maintaining monoculture, is an unsuspected victim. It's how we've farmed for centuries. In The Hobbit, tilling gets a callout for being extra fertile: <br><br>"Bard had rebuilt the town in Dale and men had gathered to him from the Lake and from South and West, and all the valley had become tilled again and rich, and the desolation was now	filled	with birds and blossoms in spring and fruit and feasting in autumn. And Lake-town was refounded and was more prosperous than ever, and much	wealth	went up	and	down the Running River;	and there was friendship in	those parts between elves and dwarves and men."<br><br> It's obvious that tilling fertile land won't bring world peace, but we don't know how its contributing to its end. In the 1930's, people in Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico lost everything when their soil became Dust. Overfarming leads soil to lose its nitrogen and organic matter, turning damp, black, carbon-dioxide consuming, life-giving soil, to dead dust. Soil is alive, and we're killing it. <br><br> Just like a forest or ocean, soil is an ecosystem, full of symbiosis. In a healthy soil ecosystem, there is bacteria to fix nitrogen, fungi connecting to plant roots, plants to hold the soil down, and lots of decomposers to break down organic matter. When we till and plant monocultures, this ecosystem dies, and the soil can no longer nourish the plants. For example, let's look at the nitrogen cycle. <br><br>Nitrogen is a necessary element to all plant life. Luckily, the atmosphere is 80% nitrogen! Unluckily, that nitrogen is bonded to itself in a way that makes it unaccessible to plants. They cannot consume nitrogen from the air in the same way that thirsty sailors cannot rely on the ocean. Luckily again, there exists bacteria that can 'fix' nitrogen in the soil. Unluckily again, exploitative farming removes nitrogen from the soil faster than bacteria can replenish it, making it harder and harder to grow food for the world. <br><br> By the 19th century, European scientists realized they were screwed. So, they began carting away South American land on boats for its fertility. After WWII, they found how to remove the nitrogen from the atmosphere themselves, and since then, we've become over-reliant on synthetic fertilizer that damages aquatic ecosystems and raises soil pH to levels bacteria cannot handle. This alongside the overuse of pesticides and herbicides has caused an ecological disaster, as farmers are reliant on expensive and dangerous chemicals, surrounding ecosystems die, and the land literally turns to dust and disappears. <br> </p>
        
        <h2> The Solution:</h2>
        
        <p class="text-content"> For such a vast problem, it may feel like there is no solution. But in fact, the solution has existed for longer than traditional farming.Regenerative farming is a method of growing crops that regenerates soil, a process that indigenous Americans used long before their land was taken and destroyed. Regenerative practices not only protect soil ecosystems, they also increase yield and save farmers money. <br><br> While there is no single way to farm regeneratively, the spirit is to give up synthetic fertilizers and toxic chemicals, and take actions to re-built the ecosystem under our feet. For example, Robin Wall Kimmerer writes about the "Three Sisters" in Braiding Sweetgrass. The sisters are corn, who grows fast and sturdy, beans, who climb corn and have symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and squash, who's low-laying leaves prevent the growth of unwanted plants. The USDA calls this intercropping: planting multiple crops together to foster mutualistic relationships. <br><br> Other regenerative practices include "no-till," where farmers scrap the plow alltogether, and agroforestry, where planting trees among their fields provides shade, a habitat for birds, and a place for pollinators to build a home. These methods of farming protect ecosystems, and importantly for farmers, save money. Farmers choosing regenerative methods make 70% more profit off of what they grow, because instead of paying for band-aid solutions to make up for the soil's disease, they simply heal the soil. <br><br>The solution is so clear that it's painful to watch massive industrial farms destroy ecosystems without second thought. As consumers, we must be conscious about the impact our food has, good or bad. And as the generation invested in the replenishment of nature, we  </p>
