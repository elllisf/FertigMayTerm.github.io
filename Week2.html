        <h3> Food Systems:</h3>
        
        <p> Where does food come from? The answer may be obvious for a zucchini, but what about the oreos and instant ramen? The answer invariable begins outside, likely on a farm. Even more, where does the food we don't eat go? Yes, the trash can, but how often do we consider what happens next?<br><br> For many, food essentially spawns into existance at the grocery store, and then leaves through the black void of a garbage can. Our food system is a broken cycle. Because we overuse soil, there is little fixed nitrogen on farms to nourish plants, so, we use the Haber-Bosch process to pluck nitrogen molecules from the air and turn it into accessible ammonia. This process is energy intensive, and the fertilizer we put on farms destroys soil before running off to a local aquatic ecosystem, causing an influx of algae and the death of fish. After we eat the food grown from this process, we put it in the fridge, wait for mold, and then throw it into that void and never see it again. And, instead of using the nitrogen already in those food scraps, we burn them, creating greenhouse gas nitrous oxide and polluting the air of local communities. <br><br> The cycles that dictate the world: the water cycle, carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, are now straight lines. Americans throw out one third of their food that has caused environmental detriment, to go off to give kids asthma. We could avoid much of this waste by composting, both backyard and via regular compost-pickup. But as Americans, our understanding of waste itself is fundamentally misguided.<br><br> When discussing my frustration for the broken nitrogen cycle with a teacher, he shared a similar frustration over wasted food: how we don't eat all of the fruits that trees drop. How those could feed the hungry and mitigate our waste problem. However, if a blackberry bush in a forest is not picked dry by humans, is it wasted? Or do those fruits feed the soil, the animals, and contribute to the general ecosystem? And when we produce double the amount of food we need to feed every single person on earth, is it even possible to waste?<br><br> We as a society view anything that we do not consume as waste. Oranges eaten by bugs? Waste. Land that's not farmed? Waste. Animals kept past their prime? Waste. Even among environmentalists, our consumerism prevails. Because of this mindset, we've "optimized" activities like farming to produce the most with the least amount of resources without considering the impact on non-human friends.<br><br> I'd like to propose a new definition of waste. Waste is not what doesn't feed us, but rather everything that escapes those essential cycles. Plastic is wasted because those carbon polymers have escaped the cycle of building life. Uncomposted food waste is waste because it destroys the nitrogen cycle. Fuel is wasted when we burn fossil fuels despite available renewables because we are using it at a rate too fast for the cycle to replenish. And the money farmers are forced to spend on fertilizer and equipment and chemicals is waste because that method of farming will not pay them back.<br><br> Under the Gaia hypothesis, the Earth is alive because it has regulatory cycles to keep it in check. We, bodies made up of reconstructed pieces of Earth, idiotically view ourselves as separate from these cycles, when in reality, those destroyed cycles will destroy us.</p>
