        <p class="text">For my senior year Mayterm, I am analyzing the 
        relationship between modern humans and land through an agricultural lens. 
            (STATISTICS AND INFORMATION!!!)
        I am particularly focusing on soil health, organic eating, alongside 
        philosophy. Join me on my journey to achieve a greater understanding 
        of our unnatural world.</p>
