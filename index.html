        <h4 class="subhead"> A May Term Project by Ellis Fertig</h4>

        <p class="text">For my senior year Mayterm, I am investigating the 
        relationship between modern humans and land through an agricultural lens. Due to modern technology, the world produces enough calories to feed double the global population. However, modern farming contributes to climate change and major biodiversity loss by destroying soil ecosystems. Food systems contribute to one third of global carbon emissions. My goal is to study why our current methods are failing and what solutions have the potential to shift global practices.</p>

            <div><h4 class="text-content"> <span style="font-size:30px";>Week 1:</span> <br>During my first week, I investigated how regnerative and traditional methods of farming impact soil, and what the crop implications are. Soil health is determined by its ability to act as a functioning ecosystem, home to diverse life, including bugs, bacteria, and fungi. Practices like monocultures, excessive fertilizer and pesticide use, and tilling, destroy soil health by harming an ecosystem, impacting the long-term value of the soil. With approaches such as no-till, cover cropping, and intercropping, the soil can regain biodiversity and begin to act as a carbon-sync. </h4></div>

            <h4 class="text-content"><span style="font-size:30px";>Week 2:</span> <br> During my second week, I examined the relationship between an American diet and American farming practices. On the one hand, the consumer supports unsustainable corn monocultures with nearly every purchase, and on the other, excessive amounts of unsustainable corn and soybean products are inadvertently snuck into food products, allowing food processers to both cause and profit off of America's health epidemics. This becomes a positive feedback loop where we fund the systems feeding us, and they also happen to be killing us. </h4>
